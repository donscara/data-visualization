Data Visualization Projects
4 Lab assignments:
1) Use of Python in regard to data visualization, analyze different datasets, explore common IDEs that can be used with Python environment to set up the underlying architecture, and to visualize data in different ways.
2) Use of Geospatial libraries of Python regarding data visualization, analyze different datasets, explore common applications of these libraries. Throughout global
pandemics such as the Covid19 pandemic, voluminous individuals spent lots of time viewing maps that visualize data accordingly. There is an increase in the need for individuals with data science knowledge to understand metrics about terrestrial areas, analyze data, make strategies and predictions that take both local and global conditions as well as rules into account, and so on.
3) Use of OpenCV, math, time, and other related libraries of Python regarding data visualization of video analysis and manipulations, analyze videos and images,
explore common applications of these libraries.
The project include:
• Use OpenCV and other video processing and manipulation related libraries in Python
• Implement videos reading and manipulations
• Download and read video and image frames manipulations using Python libraries like OpenCV, math, time, and NumPy
• Create plots of capturing images and videos using a camera as well as writing and reading video files to the disk, and so on.
• Design a scenario to detect a moving object in a video file through single frame manipulations.
4) Use of NumPy, Pandas, Pyplot, Seaborn, sklearn, imblearn, and other related libraries of Python regarding data visualization of cybersecurity and network intrusion, analyze cyber-attacks, and explore common applications of these libraries.
The project include:
• Use network intrusion and cybersecurity-related libraries in Python
• Use different cyber-attacks and network intrusion detection and manipulations techniques
• Download and use cybersecurity-related datasets using Python libraries like OpenCV and NumPy
• Created plots capturing the different type of attacks in different cities and parts of the world with respect to the number of cyber-attacks in that region, and so on.
• Designed a scenario to detect network intrusion using Python Libraries.
